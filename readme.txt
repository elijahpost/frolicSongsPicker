This script tries to keep me motivated to practice the drums by effectively
texting me the names of two randomly selected songs from my band FROLIC at a
given point in time of the day in an attempt to keep me motivated to practice.

Background:

I play drums for FROLIC, a thrash metal band based out of Hayward, CA.

Let me take this moment to encourage you to check FROLIC out on Spotify!

And follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/frolicbayarea/

Since I also work in tech full-time, it can be hard to have the motivation
to practice every single day.

This script runs on my machine in the background and emails the name
of two randomly selected songs from the FROLIC catelogue to play. The email
address I'm sending to is provided by my phone carrier and automatically
converts it to a text message which I get on my phone.

Ideally this will give me the motivation to jam through at least two songs,
and make me think about how I might transition between those or any two should
they ever be next to eachother on the setlist at a gig.

Note:

Along with my email credentials, The variable that holds the list of all
FROLIC songs is hidden away. This is because the list contains songs that we
have not released...yet.
